All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on

to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-09

### Added

- `skillpack init` — introspect a repo (Rust, npm, Python, Go, Ruby), interview
  the maintainer (or run non-interactive from `skillpack.toml`), and generate
  the three Claude Code distribution files (`marketplace.json`, `plugin.json`,
  `SKILL.md`). Pure-library path when no CLI is detected (documents the install
  + import pattern instead of an invocation).
- `skillpack verify` — discovery checks (kebab-case + reserved-name validation,
  1,536-char listing cap, `when_to_use` trigger phrases, `./`-prefixed paths)
  and invocation checks (`--help` runs under timeout; every documented flag
  exists in real `--help` output). Exits non-zero on critical failure for use
  as a CI PR gate.
- Pre-commit verification: `init` runs the full `verify` suite against its own
  output before writing files.
- `--non-interactive`, `--accept-warnings`, `--license <SPDX>`, `--verbose`,
  `--debug` flags.
- GitHub Actions CI: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -D
  warnings`, and `cargo test -- --include-ignored` (runs the Go + Ruby
  `#[ignore]`-gated round trips where those runtimes are present).
- Insta snapshot tests pinning byte-identical output of all three generated
  files for CLI and pure-library profiles.
- Test fixtures for rust, node, python, go, ruby CLIs and a node library;
  a `broken-cli` fixture for drift detection.

### Toolchain

- Pin Rust 1.95.0 via `rust-toolchain.toml` so local and CI fmt/clippy agree.
